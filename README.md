# MyToken Smart Contract

A simple ERC-20 like token implementation on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for minting and burning of tokens.

## Description

The `MyToken` contract is designed to manage a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionalities to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens. The contract keeps track of the total supply of tokens and the balances of individual addresses. It is a straightforward implementation to help understand the fundamentals of token management on the blockchain.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this contract, you'll need the following:
* An Ethereum development environment like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).
* A connection to the Ethereum network (mainnet, testnet, or local development network).

### Executing program

To deploy and interact with the `MyToken` contract, follow these steps:

1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - Open your Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix IDE).
   - Copy the `MyToken` contract code into a new Solidity file.
   - Compile the contract.
   - Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network.
   - After deployment, note the contract address for further interactions.

2. **Mint Tokens:**
   - To mint new tokens, call the `mint` function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to be minted.
   ```solidity
   mint("0xRecipientAddress", 100);
   ```
   - This will increase the total supply and add tokens to the specified address.

3. **Burn Tokens:**
   - To burn existing tokens, call the `burn` function with the address holding the tokens and the amount of tokens to be burned.
   ```solidity
   burn("0xHolderAddress", 50);
   ```
   - This will decrease the total supply and remove tokens from the specified address if it has sufficient balance.

## Help

If you encounter common problems or issues, ensure that:
- The address involved in minting or burning tokens is valid and has enough balance (in the case of burning).
- The Ethereum network you're connected to is working correctly.
